# DataVis
This program visualises and generates data related to few-shot classification of time-series. Most of the actual generation is from https://github.com/kris701/P8, where this project simply makes changes to allow it to work with a GUI.

Do note: This repo is simply for future reference for myself. You're welcome to view, but changes will likely not be made.
